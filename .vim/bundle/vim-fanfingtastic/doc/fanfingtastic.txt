 1. INTRODUCTION                                           *fanfingtastic-intro*

Fanf,ingTastic; is a Vim plugin that enhances the builtin |F| |f| |,| |T| |t|
and |;| keys by allowing them to wrap over lines with the full gamut of
normal, visual and operator pending mode support. This is all the default
configuration of Fanf,ingTastic; provides, however the following enhanced
functionality can be enabled through configuration options:

Ignore Case~

Fanf,ingTastic; is case sensitive by default. The |fanfingtastic-ignorecase|
option allows you to find both 'x' and 'X' with either fx or fX.

Aliases~

Fanf,ingTastic; allows you to create aliases which specify a set of characters
that will be scanned for when FfTt;, is used on that alias. For example:
>
  :FanfingTasticAlias b ()
  :FanfingTasticAlias B {}
<
would allow fb to search forward to the next '(' or ')' character (spanning
lines as necessary). Likewise, TB would scan backwards (spanning lines) to
place the cursor just to the right hand side of the '{' or '}' character prior
to the cursor's current position. Of course, with both of these aliases
enabled, the user will not be able to find plain 'b' or 'B' characters with
the fFtT;, commands. See |fanfingtastic-aliases| for more details.

The following options alter the behaviour of Fanf,ingTastic;

|'fanfingtastic_all_inclusive'|	Makes backward movements to be |inclusive|.
|'fanfingtastic_map_over_leader'|	Maps over [,;] even if they are the
				current |mapleader|.
|'fanfingtastic_fix_t'|		Fixes the behavior of tT,; and a count.
|'fanfingtastic_ignorecase'|	Provides case insensitive FfTt,; finding.
|'fanfingtastic_use_jumplist'|	Adds the movements with fFtT;, to the |jumplist|.

                                                 *'fanfingtastic-all-inclusive'*
                                               *'g:fanfingtastic_all_inclusive'*
Values: boolean
Default: 0                                                                   ~

Backward movements (namely F, T and ; or , depending on the last movement) are
|exclusive| by default, 'fanfingtastic_all_inclusive' changes that so they
behave like |inclusive| movements. To enable this, add the following line to
your $MYVIMRC:
>
  let g:fanfingtastic_all_inclusive = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               *'fanfingtastic-map-over-leader'*
                                             *'g:fanfingtastic_map_over_leader'*
Values: boolean
Default: 0                                                                   ~

Fanf,ingTastic; maps over the [fFtT,;] keys in its aim to fully emulate and
augment the equivalent builtin functionality. Some people however prefer to
use either the comma or semicolon key as their |mapleader|. By default,
Fanf,ingTastic; will not map over your mapleader. To allow this, add the
following line to your $MYVIMRC:
>
  let g:fanfingtastic_map_over_leader = 1 <

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         *'fanfingtastic-fix-t'*
                                                       *'g:fanfingtastic_fix_t'*
Values: boolean
Default: 0                                                                   ~

The commands |t| and |T| when used with the cursor right in front of the
searched character will decrease the given |count| by 1. Enabling
'fanfingtastic_fix_t' changes that so that Vim uses the given count as
expected. To enable this, add the following line to your $MYVIMRC:
>
  let g:fanfingtastic_fix_t = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    *'fanfingtastic-ignorecase'*
                                                  *'g:fanfingtastic_ignorecase'*
Values: boolean
Default: 0                                                                   ~

Enabling 'fanfingtastic-ignorecase' allows the FfTt,; commands to find case
insensitive matches of the specified character. For example, fx will find the
next 'x' or 'X' character. To enable this, add the following line to your
$MYVIMRC:
>
  let g:fanfingtastic_ignorecase = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  *'fanfingtastic-use-jumplist'*
                                                *'g:fanfingtastic_use_jumplist'*
Values: boolean
Default: 0                                                                   ~

When this option is enabled movements made with fFtT;, will be added to the
|jumplist|. To enable this, add the following line to your $MYVIMRC:
>
  let g:fanfingtastic_use_jumplist = 1
<
